                The causes are not a mystery. The U.S. still lacks a coherent testing
                strategy, and large parts of the country continue to defy basic health
                advice. One example is Mitchell, a small South Dakota city, where deaths
                have spiked recently &#x2014; including the loss of a beloved high school
                coach. Yet anti-mask protesters continue to undermine the local response.
