# Applying Test Driven Development to parsing and manipulating HTML

### Technologies used
- cheerio https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio
- lit-html-server https://www.npmjs.com/package/@popeindustries/lit-html-server

### Instructions 

We will focus on the code in [removeInlineStyle](./src/removeStyle/removeInlineStyle.js)   
Out objective is to  
1) take a NYT newsletter in HTML format
1) strip away some of the inline style that causes issues when converting it to an EPUB document

In the file [removeInlineStyle.spec](src/removeStyle/removeInlineStyle.spec.js) you will find some tests written in jest. The first two tests will pass as the code for them is complete. You will need to complete the code to make the tests pass and in some cases also write the tests yourself.
